Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve smaller versions of the same problem. Instead of writing long, repetitive code, recursion allows us to write cleaner and simpler solutions â€” especially for problems that have a repeating pattern.

How Does It Simplify Problems?
  
Recursion is helpful when:

The problem can be broken into smaller subproblems of the same type
The solution involves repeated patterns, like tree traversal, factorial, Fibonacci series, or searching through nested data structures
Instead of using complex loops or manually tracking steps, recursion lets us solve the problem in a more intuitive and mathematically structured way.
