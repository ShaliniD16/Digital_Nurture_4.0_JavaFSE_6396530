<h2>Explaining the Concept of Recursion</h2>

<p><strong>Recursion</strong> is a programming concept where a function calls <strong>itself</strong> to solve smaller versions of the same problem. Instead of writing long, repetitive code, recursion allows us to write cleaner and simpler solutions â€” especially for problems that have a <em>repeating pattern</em>.</p>


<h3> How Does It Simplify Problems?</h3>

<p>Recursion is helpful when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The problem can be broken into <strong>smaller subproblems</strong> of the same type</li>
  <li>The solution involves <em>repeated patterns</em>, like tree traversal, factorial, Fibonacci series, or searching through nested data structures</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of using complex loops or manually tracking steps, recursion lets us solve the problem in a more <strong>intuitive</strong> and <strong>mathematically structured</strong> way.</p>
